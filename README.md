### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hillary and I'm a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) in the [Climate Data Science Lab](https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html?source=post_page-----4bc4314ac02d----------------------). I recieved my PhD in Physical Oceanography in 2020 from the University of Washington where I studied the drivers, trends, and patterns of extreme ocean warming events called marine heatwaves.

My current research interests include contributing to open-source software and understanding the complex spatiotemporal variability of geophysical fluids and their impacts. You can learn more about me [here](https://www.hillaryscannell.com/)!

- ðŸ”­ &nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™m currently working on eddy detection using machine learning.

- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me about open & reproducible research, multiple object tracking, or running quasi-geostrophic idealized models in Python. 

- ðŸ“« &nbsp;&nbsp;You can find my contact info [here](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/user/scannell).
